                    <li>CLEANS BETTER THAN THE COMPETITION – Trusted by professional cleaners, our magic eraser sponges are larger, thicker, clean better and last longer than any other. Made with premium quality melamine foam, our extra dense design easily lifts away dirt and grime.</li>
                    <li>2X THICKER, 2X LONGER LASTING – Most melamine sponge bulk packs come with tiny sponges that crumble and fall apart immediately. You deserve better. Our magic erasers are the thickest and largest scrubbers you can buy anywhere.</li>
                    <li>JUST ADD WATER TO ERASE – Put away that smelly bleach. Say no to abrasive, corrosive chemicals. Grab the gentle, more effective, odor-free, and non-toxic cleaning alternative. Simply Wet, Squeeze, and Wipe. It’s that easy.</li>
                    <li>MULTI-PURPOSE CLEANER – Effortlessly cut through grease, soap scum and “permanent” marks. Use in your kitchen, bathroom, walls, doors, floors, shoes, car, toilet, sink, and more – without the scrubbing and elbow grease.</li>
                    <li>100% MONEY BACK GUARANTEE – If you are not absolutely thrilled with your Oh My Clean Eraser Sponges, return them for a full refund. No questions asked. We stand behind the quality of our products and are confident you will LOVE your eraser sponges.</li>
